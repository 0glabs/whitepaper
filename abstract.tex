\begin{abstract}
The trend of Web3.0 has driven the data storage infrastructure to develop from the centralized scheme towards the decentralized world, where the data can acquire the permanent existence and can really belong to the person who creates them rather than owned by the monopolist, and hence the data are allowed to enter the value internet and associated with value properties. Although some existing projects, e.g., Filecoin, Arweave, etc., pioneered this trend, the current solutions are still immature and need large amount of further improvement. \project is a project that re-thinks and redesigns the full storage stack in the decentralized world. Unlike the existing solutions, \project targets to enable the whole cloud scenarios in a Web3.0 way. It is far from a mere archive system. It provides the data durability, efficient data indexing and readability, and also data mutability and atomicity with transactional semantics through layered abstraction and modular system design. Through this design philosophy, it achieves the huge scalability with respect to both the data access performance and the development of the system. Therefore, \project facilitates the transition of the most traditional big-data and internet applications from Web2.0 to Web3.0.
